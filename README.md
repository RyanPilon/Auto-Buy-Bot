### Buy your favorite items first before they run out of stock!!


This is a buy bot designed to get an input of a URL and a unique class to the add to cart or purchase now button on a website and keep trying the buy now button until it is available. 

In order to run it you need chromedriver `https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads` and the path to the extracted chromedriver file only based on your version of google chrome you are currently running (use <google-chrome --version> in terminal to check current version). 

Also need to install selenium (I used <sudo pip3 install selenium> to get it working on my ubuntu system).
